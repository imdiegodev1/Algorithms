# Algorithms

This is an excellent programming exercise where my intention is that you can explore basic programming concepts, evaluate algorithmic complexity and explore the syntax of the same functionality in different programming languages. For now you can find:

- Sorting algorithms
- Search algorithms

This is a work in progress where I want to share with you my learnings and mistakes. I assure you that in the future you will be able to find many other algorithms as well as programming languages.
